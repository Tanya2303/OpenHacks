# ProjectLift

## üí° Inspiration

Open source projects are critical to technological progress and the growth of the technology industry. Managing and adding to multiple duties at the same time, on the other hand, can be time-consuming and overwhelming. As a result, many coders may not have the time or resources to effectively contribute to the open source community. This utility aims to handle this issue by making it easier for programmers to share and collaborate with others in the community by simplifying the process of keeping and contributing to numerous open source projects.

Finding the correct initiative to contribute to can be difficult, particularly for novices. Even experienced developers may have difficulty finding new tasks that match their hobbies and abilities. This tool seeks to address this problem by providing users with a centralised platform for discovering, evaluating, and contributing to open source projects.

## üíª What it does

On ProjectLift users can:

- Centralized dashboard to manage multiple projects.
- Automated alerts for new issues, pull requests, and other activity related to a user's projects.
- Analytics to help users track their contributions and measure their impact on the open source community.
- A personalized recommendation system based on a user's interests and skills.
- Search and filtering options to help users find projects that match their criteria.
- Project evaluation metrics, such as community engagement, documentation quality, and issue resolution speed, to help users make informed decisions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Firebase: For backend
- Firebase Storage: For storing images
- Tailwind CSS: For easy styling
